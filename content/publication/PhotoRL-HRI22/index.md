abstract: "Recent research in robot learning suggests that implicit human feedback is a low-cost approach to improving robot behavior without the typical teaching burden on users. Because implicit feedback can be difficult to interpret, though, we study different methods to collect fine-grained labels from users about robot performance across multiple dimensions, which can then serve to map implicit human feedback to performance values. In particular, we focused on understanding the effects of annotation order and frequency on human perceptions of the self-annotation process and the usefulness of the labels for creating data-driven models to reason about implicit feedback. Our results demonstrate that different annotation methods can influence perceived memory burden, annotation difficulty, and overall annotation time. Based on our findings, we conclude with recommendations to create future implicit feedback datasets in Human-Robot Interaction."
